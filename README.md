## Where should the home investors invest in the US for maximum returns. 

Our project will focus on incorporating economic factors such as income, education, migration, current tax climate, crime rates, environmental factors, etc. to analyze how they affect the property values across the country. 

We aim to list top 25 cities in the US where it would be most profitable for the home investors in the coming 5 years. To find this, we will run Multiple Linear Regression and Logistic Regression to then find the predicted prices of homes in future. 

Our data is will be coming from: Kaggle, US Census Bureau, Zillow, QuandL, etc.
