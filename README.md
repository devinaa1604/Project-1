Where are they (maybe:home buyers) coming from and why and what does that mean for Texas Property Values?
Real Estate Trends In Housing, Interest Rates, Relocation/Migration patterns for the last “Time Frame; TBD”
What are the hot spots in Texas (top 5 cities):  El Paso, DFW, Houston, Austin, San Antonio.

Where are they coming from (Top 5 States migrating to Texas)?  Is data readily available.  Buyer was located elsewhere, now lcoated in Texas
What Demographics are making up these nomads (cowboys).  How demographics (age, income, family status) and motivations, etc. Influnence where buyer is relocating?

Will our data validate the claim that our subjects are relocating based on a combination of factors but not limited to those highlighted?

Factors to consider for relocation may/may not correlate to nomads moving to Texas’ Top 5 Cities:

- Pollution rates/Env Data
- Employment Data
- Education / Property Tax Values -> Property prices
- Mortgage Rate Data
- Current Tax Climate in States leaving
- Urban Centralization
- Crime Rates
- Corp Relocations
- Weather
