## AIM
Our aim was to make a model of housing prices that mimic the infamous Boston Housing Data but on a macro level. We wanted to use Multiple Linear Regression in order to predict the housing prices and make an interactive dashboard which tells the top 25 cities in US for home investors in the next 5 years.

## METHODOLOGY
To achieve this, we started with looking at data sets of variables that could possibly have a correlation with housing returns such as:
  1. Income
  2. Education
  3. Migration
  4. Tax environment
  5. Crime Rates
  6. Environmental Factors

Our data source ranged from:
  1. Kaggle
  2. Zillow
  3. QuandL
  4. Economic Research Service: United States Department of Agriculture
  
## DATA
### Migration Data

### Crime Data

### Problems with data
As we got aquatinted with the terms such as FIPS and CBSA codes, we realized that it is much difficult for us to find the data that matches these county and MSA codes and along with that we needed the data to be in the same time frame, with all yearly data in a format that can be used to run regressions. Therefore, we moved to our alternate plan. 

### Regression data
This data was aquired from "Economic Research Service: United States Department of Agriculture" which followed FIPS (so data was for all the counties in the USA) and
